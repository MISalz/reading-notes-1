## Introductory HTML and JavaScript

HTMl files are text documents that give structure to a website. They consist of tags that give the information they surround special meaning. Opening tags have attributes that gives more information on the content of that element. 

DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you are using. The id and class attributes allow you to identify certain elements in order to manipulate the styles. Span attributes will do the same but to inline content. Meta tags allow you to supply your web content with information. Escape characters are used to include special characters into your webpage that is normally reserved for html code. 

New HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of different parts of the webpage, and assist in making clearer code.
